# Zetteler
## Technologies?
1. HuGO theme
2. PWA
3. Protocol/Data model for tools to be built on top of

## Design Priniciples
0. cards are simple and should be limited as much as possible with word count, formatting, etc. (it is possible rules for limiting the extensibility of an individual card should be set)
1. interacting with the zettel should be textualar
2. card files should be named with a uuid based on creation time (I like unix time stamps)
3. zettels should be immutable at a system level such that rich metal data on the state of zettel updates can be maintained
4. tags are use to create heirarchical knowledge i.e. venn diagrams that individiaul cards fall into
5. links can arbitrarily be created between cards
